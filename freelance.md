# Strategic AI Operations — Freelance Services

## What I Do
I bridge the AI Implementation Gap for businesses that cannot afford to get AI wrong. No chatbots, no magic tricks — deterministic business systems that protect your P&L.

## Services

### AI Infrastructure Architecture
- Replace SaaS per-seat costs with owned, self-hosted AI assets
- RAG pipeline design with enterprise-grade context retrieval
- Agent orchestration — not prompt engineering, but system engineering

### Human-in-the-Loop Governance
- Compliance-first automation for regulated industries (pharma, legal, finance)
- A-V-C Framework implementation: Accountability → Verifiability → Consequence
- Audit trails and deterministic output guarantees

### Strategic Tech Leadership (Fractional CTO/COO)
- Enterprise digital transformation — bridging engineering teams and C-suite strategy
- Legacy system modernization with AI-native architecture
- Build vs. Buy analysis: when to kill the SaaS and build the asset
