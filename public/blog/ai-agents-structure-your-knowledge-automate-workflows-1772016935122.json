  "noise": "OpenAI just announced 'Harness Engineering,' their new internal system where AI agents, called Codex, are writing large-scale software. They claim a beta product with a million lines of code was shipped in five months with no manually written source code, guided by a small team of engineers.",
  "translation": "You're not building large software applications, but the underlying lesson is vital. This isn't about AI replacing your team; it's about *delegating* complex, structured tasks. For your firm, it means using your internal knowledge – your procedures, your templates, your client history – as the 'single source of truth' that AI agents can then leverage to automate repetitive tasks, from drafting initial documents to managing client communication.",
  "action": "My concrete advice: identify one repetitive, rule-based process in your firm – perhaps initial client intake forms, or drafting standard contracts. Spend the next month *structuring* your internal documentation around this process, making it explicit and machine-readable. Don't think about buying a fancy AI yet; focus on cleaning your house. This disciplined approach is how you prepare for effective AI delegation, saving you thousands later. Start this quarter.",
