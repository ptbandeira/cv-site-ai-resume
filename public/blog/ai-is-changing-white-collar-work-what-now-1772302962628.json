  "noise": "The AI scare turned real this week in the US, with Block CEO Jack Dorsey announcing a 40% staff reduction, directly attributing it to the capabilities of new ‘intelligence tools.’ This move, which saw Block’s stock rise, followed viral essays predicting widespread white-collar job displacement.",
  "translation": "This isn't about a 'doomsday' scenario for your European law firm or consultancy. What it means is that the efficiency gains from AI are no longer theoretical; they are driving tangible restructuring in major companies. For you, this translates into a clear signal: specific tasks currently performed by white-collar staff can and will be automated, freeing up valuable human capital for higher-value work.",
  "action": "My concrete recommendation for you is to stop waiting. Start an internal workflow audit *today*. Identify the 20% of repetitive, predictable tasks that consume 80% of your team's time – things like initial document review, data entry, or first-draft communications. I can guide your team through this audit and pilot a relevant AI solution within 3 months, shifting your focus from fear to competitive advantage.",
