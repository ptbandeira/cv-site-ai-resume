  "noise": "Anthropic's Boris Cherny, creator of their Claude Code AI agent, warns that AI agents will \"painfully\" reshape nearly every computer-based job, with significant changes starting as early as 2026. He emphasizes these agents can increasingly operate computers autonomously.",
  "translation": "This isn't abstract tech talk for Silicon Valley; it directly impacts your European law firm, accountancy, or consultancy. It means AI is moving beyond simple chatbots to tools that can *act* on your computer systems—analyzing contracts, preparing reports, or managing client communications. Ignoring this shift will put you at a significant competitive disadvantage very soon.",
  "action": "My advice is direct: start experimenting, not just observing. Pick a small, repetitive digital task within your firm – perhaps document review or data entry – and assign a small team to explore how current AI agents can automate or assist. My clients often start with low-cost platform access, focusing on understanding the *how* and *why* before committing to larger investments.",
