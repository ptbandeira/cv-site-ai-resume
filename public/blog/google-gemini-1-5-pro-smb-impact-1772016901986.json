  "noise": "Google has announced the general availability of Gemini 1.5 Pro, their advanced AI model, now offering a massive 2 million token context window for enterprise clients and 1 million tokens generally. This means the model can process extremely long documents, codebases, and even entire videos at once.",
  "translation": "For European SMBs like yours, this isn't just a headline about bigger numbers; it's about practical capability. While the 2-million token window is currently for \"enterprise,\" the 1-million window is available now and is more than enough to handle your longest legal briefs, financial reports, or complex client documents securely through Google Cloud. This significantly reduces the need to break down information, making analysis and summarization much more efficient for your team.",
  "action": "My immediate advice is to pilot Gemini 1.5 Pro via Google Cloud's Vertex AI for one specific, high-volume document processing task. Focus on summarization, key information extraction, or cross-referencing within large internal documents. Don't build a full-scale solution yet; instead, dedicate 2-3 days over the next month to test its capabilities with actual firm data (anonymized if necessary) to see the real-world impact and cost efficiency before any larger investment.",
