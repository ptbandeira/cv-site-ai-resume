  "noise": "Google I/O announced significant advancements in Android, particularly focusing on integrating Gemini Nano for powerful on-device AI capabilities. This means more privacy-centric AI features directly on your mobile devices.",
  "translation": "Forget the hype about cloud AI for a moment. This update is crucial because \"on-device\" means AI processing happens *locally* on your phone, not in Google's data centres. For your law firm, accountancy, or consultancy, this directly addresses data sovereignty and confidentiality concerns when using AI for tasks like summarizing calls or drafting secure notes on the go. It means secure, AI-powered productivity without compromising client trust.",
  "action": "I recommend you review your firm's mobile device policy this quarter. Identify specific tasks where on-device AI could boost individual productivity while keeping sensitive client data local. We can conduct a rapid 2-hour assessment to pinpoint these opportunities and outline a secure integration strategy.",
