It's a signal to start preparing for the August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement with tools you already own.",
  "action": "I can audit your current Microsoft 365 usage and identify immediate, secure Copilot applications for your regulated business. We'll set up a governed pilot, ensuring data stays local and aligns with EU AI Act readiness. Stop paying for it without using it.",
