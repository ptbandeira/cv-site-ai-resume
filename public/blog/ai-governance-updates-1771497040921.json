  "noise": "EC finalizes EU AI Act high-risk list & conformity standards. 6-month compliance window opens for regulated sectors.",
  "translation": "The grace period is over. Know if your AI is 'high-risk' and start your conformity assessment. This isn't just a legal check; it's a technical audit requiring deep dive into your AI systems.",
  "action": "I can lead your cross-functional team (legal, tech, operations) to map your AI systems against the new high-risk criteria, assess conformity, and implement the required technical documentation & governance. This isn't rocket science; it's structured process work, like ISO 9001 in the 90s, but for AI. Expect 4-6 weeks for initial assessment.",
