  "noise": "Microsoft unveiled new Azure AI services for EU data residency, including private cloud Copilot deployments. This targets regulated industries ahead of the EU AI Act enforcement in August 2026.",
  "translation": "For European mid-market firms, your Copilot can now live securely within EU private clouds. No more GDPR excuses for not using AI with sensitive data. This is the architecture that actually makes AI Act compliance tractable — and if you're already paying for M365, you may already have access. The window to get this configured before August 2026 enforcement is shorter than most leadership teams think.",
  "action": "I can audit your current M365 licencing in half a day and tell you exactly which Copilot workloads can go live with EU data residency enabled — zero new vendors, zero new contracts. Most mid-market firms I work with have 3–5 immediate use cases already paid for and not deployed. That's the starting point.",
