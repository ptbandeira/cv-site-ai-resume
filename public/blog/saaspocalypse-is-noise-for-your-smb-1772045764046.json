  "noise": "The market is abuzz with \"SaaSpocalypse,\" a narrative claiming traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies are doomed. This fear, driven by AI's ability to automate code and create custom applications cheaply, has seen major software ETFs drop 30% recently.",
  "translation": "For European SMBs like yours, this \"SaaSpocalypse\" hype is mostly noise. Your core software isn't just code; it’s years of integrated data, established workflows, compliance infrastructure, and the trust built with your clients. AI can't simply replicate these deep-seated moats overnight.",
  "action": "My advice is clear: don't abandon your proven software. Instead, identify 1-2 specific, high-impact workflows – think initial client intake, document analysis, or internal knowledge retrieval – where AI can integrate directly. I can help you scope a 3-month pilot for €5,000-€10,000 to demonstrate tangible ROI within your existing setup.",
