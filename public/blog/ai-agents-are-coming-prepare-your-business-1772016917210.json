  "noise": "OpenAI has partnered with global consulting giants like McKinsey and Accenture to launch its new \"Frontier AI agent platform,\" aiming to dominate the enterprise AI market. This collaboration will see consultants help large corporations integrate AI agents into their workflows and systems.",
  "translation": "For a European SMB like yours, this isn't about buying OpenAI's new platform tomorrow. It's a clear signal: AI is moving beyond simple tools to autonomous \"agents\" that can execute complex tasks across your business software. Expect your existing SaaS vendors to rapidly embed similar agentic capabilities into the products you already use, driving a new wave of automation.",
  "action": "My advice is simple: Don't wait for these \"enterprise solutions\" to trickle down years from now. Start identifying your most repetitive, rule-based internal processes – client onboarding, document generation, data entry. Understand how an AI agent, integrated with your current tools, could automate these. This preparation ensures you're ready to leverage agentic AI when it becomes accessible and affordable for SMBs, likely within your existing software suites.",
