  "noise": "LinkedIn's latest \"Skills on the Rise\" report for 2026 highlights the fastest-growing skills in the U.S. job market, classifying them as essential \"career currency.\" The report underscores a significant shift towards AI-related competencies and critical human-centric abilities.",
  "translation": "While this report focuses on the U.S., these trends are absolutely universal for European SMBs. It's not merely about hiring new AI specialists; it's about strategically upskilling your existing 10-50 staff in both practical AI application, like prompt engineering, and the indispensable \"human-centric\" skills AI can't replicate. Your firm's competitive edge and future resilience now hinge on your team's collective skill currency.",
  "action": "My advice is direct: start by auditing your team's current capabilities against these categories, especially \"operational efficiency\" and \"AI business strategy.\" Then, invest in targeted, hands-on training. Don't chase complex, hyped AI implementations; focus on foundational skills like prompt engineering, data governance, and understanding responsible AI principles. This is a structured, ongoing investment in your people, not a one-off IT project.",
