  "noise": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns of an \"AI tsunami\" that will soon surpass human intelligence, claiming society isn't ready. This comes as his company, Anthropic, also abandoned a core safety pledge under military pressure.",
  "translation": "For European SMBs like yours, this \"tsunami\" talk is mostly noise from players with vested interests. The real story isn't a sudden, apocalyptic shift, but rather the ongoing pressure on AI developers to prioritize commercial and geopolitical gains over their own safety claims. Your challenge remains practical: how to use AI to improve your operations today, not fear a distant, ill-defined future.",
  "action": "Forget the doomsayers and their \"tsunamis.\" My advice is to ignore the dramatic headlines and focus on controlled, strategic implementation. Start with a focused 3-month pilot project: identify one bottleneck in your operations – perhaps document review or client intake – and implement a specific AI tool to address it. Measure the results, learn, and then scale.",
