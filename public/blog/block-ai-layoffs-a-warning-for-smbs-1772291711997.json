  "noise": "Jack Dorsey's Block announced it's laying off 40% of its workforce – over 4,000 people. He claims this isn't due to financial trouble, but a strategic shift, stating AI and automation enable 'a new way of working' with leaner teams.",
  "translation": "For my European SMB clients, this means something profound: even profitable, growing companies are fundamentally re-evaluating their operational models because of AI. This isn't just about 'big tech' hype; it's a clear signal that the efficiency gains from AI are significant enough to drive major strategic decisions, pushing all businesses to reconsider their current structures.",
  "action": "My advice is direct: do not wait. I recommend a focused AI operational audit, identifying 2-3 core processes in your firm – think document review, client onboarding, or data analysis – where AI can genuinely deliver a 10-20% efficiency boost. Start piloting these changes within the next 3-6 months, using existing tools or targeted solutions. This isn't about immediate cuts, but about strategically re-skilling your team and future-proofing your business before the market forces your hand.",
