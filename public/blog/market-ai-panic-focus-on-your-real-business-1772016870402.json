  "noise": "A recent fictional scenario published on Substack, projecting widespread AI-driven white-collar unemployment and economic disruption by 2028, triggered significant market sell-offs across software, delivery, and payment stocks. This \"thought experiment\" highlighted fears of AI replacing jobs and rendering established business models obsolete.",
  "translation": "For your European SMB, this market drama is mostly noise. While AI will certainly reshape workflows, the idea of \"ghost GDP\" or AI agents instantly replacing all white-collar jobs by 2028 is a speculative extreme, not your immediate reality. Your core focus should remain on strategically integrating AI to enhance productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and improve service delivery, rather than fearing an overnight collapse of your business model.",
  "action": "My advice: ignore the market theatrics and focus on controlled, incremental AI adoption. Start by identifying 2-3 specific, repetitive tasks within your operations – like document review in legal or data entry in accounting – and pilot AI tools there. Measure tangible time and cost savings over 3-6 months; this practical, use-case driven approach is how you build real competitive advantage, not by reacting to sensational headlines.",
