# AgenticOS — Sovereign AI Operations Framework

## Overview
AgenticOS is a deterministic business systems framework for regulated industries. It replaces SaaS dependencies with owned, auditable AI assets governed by Human-in-the-Loop controls.

## Architecture
- **The Bridge**: Interface layer between human intent and agent execution. Every action has an audit trail.
- **The Cortex**: Central knowledge graph. Context-aware RAG pipelines with enterprise-grade retrieval.
- **The Engine**: Execution layer. Deterministic workflows with fallback logic, not stochastic chatbots.

## Core Principles
1. **Owned Assets > SaaS Rent**: Build once, own forever. No per-seat taxes.
2. **Deterministic Output**: Every AI output is traceable, reproducible, and auditable.
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Governance**: No autonomous action without human verification for high-consequence decisions.
4. **Regulated-First Design**: Built for industries where compliance is non-negotiable — pharma, legal, finance.

## Key Differentiators
- **Anti-Misuse by Design**: Systems push back against toy use-cases. No chatbots. No magic.
- **A-V-C Framework**: Accountability → Verifiability → Consequence. Every automation passes this gate.
- **Bridge Architecture**: Pedro's 15 years bridging enterprise tech and C-suite strategy, now applied to AI operations.

## Proof Points
- Pharma compliance governance at Grupa Moja Farmacja (2020-2024)
- Enterprise Azure architecture at Microsoft/Accenture (2010-2020)
- Legal sector AgenticOS PoC for high-security document processing
