headline: For your European SMB, this market drama is mostly noise. While AI will certainly reshape workflows, the idea of "ghost GDP" or AI agents instantly replacing all white-collar jobs by 2028 is a speculative extreme, not your immediate reality. Your core focus should remain on strategically integrating AI to enhance productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and improve service delivery, rather than fearing an overnight collapse of your business model.
