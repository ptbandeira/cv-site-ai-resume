# LinkedIn Draft — For my European SMB clients, this means something profound: even profitable, growing companies are fundamentally re-evaluating their operational models because of AI. This isn't just about 'big tech' hype; it's a clear signal that the efficiency gains from AI are significant enough to drive major strategic decisions, pushing all businesses to reconsider their current structures.

The file cabinet is burning down, and many SMBs are still reorganizing their folders. Even profitable companies are fundamentally re-evaluating operations because of AI.

Jack Dorsey isn't laying off 4,000 people at Block due to financial trouble. He's claiming AI enables a "new way of working" with leaner teams. This isn't big tech hype; it's a clear signal.

Your current operational model, no matter how profitable, is now a fax machine in a world of instant messaging. Efficiency gains from AI are driving major strategic decisions across the board.

Don't wait. Identify 2-3 core processes where AI can deliver a 10-20% efficiency boost. Think document review or client onboarding. Pilot these changes in the next 3-6 months.

For executives: Start a focused AI operational audit now to re-skill your team and future-proof your business.
