# LinkedIn Draft — Forget the "vibe-coding" hype; this is about democratized workflow automation for your business. For European SMBs like yours, it means the ability to create bespoke internal mini-apps to handle repetitive, rule-based tasks without needing a developer. This isn't a silver bullet for complex systems, but a powerful tool to automate those niche, time-consuming processes that often fall through the cracks of standard software.

Your business doesn't need another file cabinet, it needs a smart intern for the grunt work.

Google's new Opal tool lets anyone build custom automations with plain language. Think of it as replacing your switchboard operator for repetitive, rule-based tasks. This isn't about replacing your core systems; it's about handling those niche processes that usually get done manually, or not at all.

For European SMBs, this means bespoke mini-apps without hiring a developer. It's like having a fax machine that not only sends documents but also knows exactly where to file them after.

Don't overthink this. Pick one tedious, low-risk internal process. Automate that. Learn its quirks before you try to digitize your entire Rolodex.

Executives: Find one small, repetitive task currently eating up staff time and automate it.
