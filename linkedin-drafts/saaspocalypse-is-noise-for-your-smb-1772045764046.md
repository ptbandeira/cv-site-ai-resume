# LinkedIn Draft — For European SMBs like yours, this "SaaSpocalypse" hype is mostly noise. Your core software isn't just code; it’s years of integrated data, established workflows, compliance infrastructure, and the trust built with your clients. AI can't simply replicate these deep-seated moats overnight.

The "SaaSpocalypse" narrative is the digital equivalent of predicting the death of the fax machine because email arrived. Your core software isn't just code; it's your business DNA.

It's years of integrated data, established workflows, and compliance infrastructure. AI can't just swipe your Rolodex and call it a client list. It won't replicate that trust overnight.

Don't ditch your proven systems like yesterday's floppy disk. Instead, pinpoint 1-2 high-impact workflows within your existing setup. Think initial client intake or internal knowledge retrieval.

Integrate AI there, like adding a better switchboard operator to an existing phone system. You'll see tangible ROI without rebuilding the entire office.

Executive takeaway: Focus on augmenting, not replacing, your foundational software.
