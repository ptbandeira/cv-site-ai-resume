# LinkedIn Draft — This isn't about a 'doomsday' scenario for your European law firm or consultancy. What it means is that the efficiency gains from AI are no longer theoretical; they are driving tangible restructuring in major companies. For you, this translates into a clear signal: specific tasks currently performed by white-collar staff can and will be automated, freeing up valuable human capital for higher-value work.

Your white-collar team isn't immune to the automation wave, and ignoring it is like trying to run a business with only a fax machine.

Jack Dorsey just cut 40% of Block's staff, crediting "intelligence tools." This isn't a doomsday prediction from some analyst; it's a real-world P&L decision. The market rewarded it.

For SMBs in Europe, this means specific, repetitive tasks your team handles daily are now prime candidates for AI. Think about the hours spent on initial document review or data entry.

Stop waiting for a memo from corporate. Audit your workflows today. Identify the 20% of predictable tasks eating 80% of your team's time.

The takeaway: Start automating the mundane now to free your best people for strategic work. Otherwise, you're just leaving money on the table.
