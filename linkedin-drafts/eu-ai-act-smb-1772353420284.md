# LinkedIn Draft — That "future problem" for high-risk AI? It's now less than six months away. Forget vendors selling easy buttons; your European SMB needs to be actively documenting,

Remember when we said AI compliance was a future problem? August 2026 is closer than your last Rolodex update.

The EU AI Act is officially live. If your SMB uses high-risk AI, those obligations aren't just a memo for later; they're a six-month sprint starting now. No easy buttons, no magic fax machine solution.

This isn't about vendors promising a plug-and-play fix. It's about getting granular with your documentation, understanding your systems, and treating compliance like a critical business function, not an afterthought.

Don't wait for the deadline to become a fire drill. Start documenting your AI systems today.
