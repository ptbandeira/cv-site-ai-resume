# LinkedIn Draft — While this report focuses on the U.S., these trends are absolutely universal for European SMBs. It's not merely about hiring new AI specialists; it's about strategically upskilling your existing 10-50 staff in both practical AI application, like prompt engineering, and the indispensable "human-centric" skills AI can't replicate. Your firm's competitive edge and future resilience now hinge on your team's collective skill currency.

Your team’s skill stack is the new Rolodex. Forget just hiring AI people.

LinkedIn's latest report on "skills on the rise" confirms what I see daily in Warsaw: it's not about new hires, it's about upskilling your existing staff of 10-50. This isn't a fax machine upgrade; it's a foundational shift.

Focus on practical AI application like prompt engineering, but don't overlook the human skills AI can't touch. Your competitive edge won't be in a fancy algorithm, but in how your people use simple tools.

Audit your team's current capabilities against operational efficiency and AI business strategy. Then, invest in structured, ongoing training. This is about skill currency, not a one-off IT project.

Executives: Treat foundational AI skills for your existing team as critical infrastructure, not a luxury.
