# LinkedIn Draft — For a European SMB like yours, this isn't about buying OpenAI's new platform tomorrow. It's a clear signal: AI is moving beyond simple tools to autonomous "agents" that can execute complex tasks across your business software. Expect your existing SaaS vendors to rapidly embed similar agentic capabilities into the products you already use, driving a new wave of automation.

Your new intern isn't a human. It's a digital agent running quietly in the background.

OpenAI just partnered with the big consulting firms to push their "agent platform" into enterprises. Think of it like the old switchboard operator, but instead of connecting calls, it's executing tasks across your software, autonomously.

For European SMBs, this isn't about buying a new platform tomorrow. It's a signal. Your existing SaaS tools – the ones you already pay for – will soon embed these agentic capabilities. Your file cabinets are about to automate themselves.

Don't wait for these enterprise solutions to trickle down. Identify your most repetitive, rule-based processes now. Client onboarding, document generation, data entry. Understand how an AI agent could automate them within your current setup.

Prepare for agents to integrate with your existing software, not replace it.
