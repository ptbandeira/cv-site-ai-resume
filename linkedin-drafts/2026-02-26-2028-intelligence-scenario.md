## POST COPY (paste as-is into LinkedIn)

A financial research firm published a scenario where the mortgage market faces a structural crisis — because AI disrupted white-collar employment faster than income assumptions in loan underwriting could adjust.

They call it a thought exercise. I'd call it an engineering problem.

The piece traces five phases: from "AI enables companies to replicate enterprise software in weeks" to "prime mortgage borrowers default on loans that were sound when originated." It maps the feedback loops. It explains why this disruption has no natural brake — AI capability improves *during* economic weakness, which is the opposite of every cyclical recession we've planned around.

The financial framing is American. The underlying dynamic — AI capability outpacing the institutional adaptation of companies, regulators, and labour markets — is not.

Two things I took from it.

**The first is technical.**

The companies that navigate structural transitions aren't the ones with the most aggressive automation. They're the ones that built governance before they needed it: clear policies on what data leaves the perimeter, which AI outputs require human review, who is accountable for AI-influenced decisions in client-facing contexts. Not compliance theatre. Architecture.

That's the work I do through [Analog AI](https://analog-ai.vercel.app).

**The second is human.**

The scenario describes mass white-collar displacement and the social consequences that follow. What a financial model doesn't capture is what this means inside individual organisations.

Companies that manage AI-driven workforce transitions deliberately — investing in psychological safety, communicating honestly about what's changing, building genuine AI literacy rather than just distributing tool licences — are in a different position. Not just ethically. Strategically.

That's the other side of the same problem. And it's what we work on at @Sirona.

Both sides matter. You can get the technical governance right and still lose the cultural capacity to use it well. You can invest in workforce wellbeing and still get the architecture wrong.

I wrote a translation of the scenario for business leaders who don't want to read a financial memo. Link in the first comment.
