# LinkedIn Draft — For European mid-market firms, your Copilot can now live securely within EU private clouds. No more GDPR excuses for not using AI with sensitive data. This is the architecture that actually makes AI Act compliance tractable — and if you're already paying for M365, you may already have access. The window to get this configured before August 2026 enforcement is shorter than most leadership teams think.

Your firm's excuses for not using AI with sensitive data just expired.

Microsoft’s new Azure AI services mean Copilot can now live securely within EU private clouds. This isn't just a compliance checkbox for the AI Act; it's the architecture that makes it actually tractable. If you're already paying for M365, you might already have access.

The window to get this configured before August 2026 enforcement is shorter than most leadership teams think. It’s like waiting for your fax machine to warm up while everyone else is on email.

I can audit your current M365 licensing in half a day. Most mid-market firms I work with have 3-5 immediate AI use cases already paid for and not deployed. That's money in a forgotten file cabinet.

Executives, identify your existing M365 spend that already covers secure EU-resident AI.
