# LinkedIn Draft — Forget the hype about cloud AI for a moment. This update is crucial because "on-device" means AI processing happens *locally* on your phone, not in Google's data centres. For your law firm, accountancy, or consultancy, this directly addresses data sovereignty and confidentiality concerns when using AI for tasks like summarizing calls or drafting secure notes on the go. It means secure, AI-powered productivity without compromising client trust.

Your data isn't always in the cloud. Google's latest Android update puts powerful AI directly on your phone. Think of it as upgrading your secure file cabinet to an AI-powered one, but it stays locked in your office.

For law firms, consultancies, or accounting practices, this is critical. Summarizing calls or drafting sensitive notes with AI can now happen locally. No more sending client data out to a big server farm to get work done.

It means secure, AI-powered productivity without the usual data sovereignty headaches. You get the efficiency without compromising client trust, which is a non-negotiable in our line of work.

Review your firm's mobile device policy this quarter. Identify specific tasks where on-device AI can boost individual productivity while keeping sensitive client data local.
