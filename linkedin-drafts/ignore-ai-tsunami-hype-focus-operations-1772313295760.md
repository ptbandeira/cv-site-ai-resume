# LinkedIn Draft — For European SMBs like yours, this "tsunami" talk is mostly noise from players with vested interests. The real story isn't a sudden, apocalyptic shift, but rather the ongoing pressure on AI developers to prioritize commercial and geopolitical gains over their own safety claims. Your challenge remains practical: how to use AI to improve your operations today, not fear a distant, ill-defined future.

The "AI tsunami" talk sounds like a bad fax machine – lots of noise, little substance. The real pressure is on AI developers to ship, not on SMBs to panic.

Forget the dramatic headlines. Your operations aren't facing a sudden apocalypse, they're facing the same bottlenecks they always have. AI just gives you a new tool, not a new problem.

Think of it like upgrading your file cabinets to a digital system. You wouldn't trash everything overnight. You'd find one pain point, test a solution, then roll it out.

Identify one operational bottleneck – maybe document review or client intake. Pilot an AI tool for three months, measure the impact, then scale. That's how you move forward, not by waiting for a mythical wave.

One specific takeaway for executives: Start with a focused 3-month AI pilot to address a single operational bottleneck.
