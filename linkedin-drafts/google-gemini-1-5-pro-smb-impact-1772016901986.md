# LinkedIn Draft — For European SMBs like yours, this isn't just a headline about bigger numbers; it's about practical capability. While the 2-million token window is currently for "enterprise," the 1-million window is available now and is more than enough to handle your longest legal briefs, financial reports, or complex client documents securely through Google Cloud. This significantly reduces the need to break down information, making analysis and summarization much more efficient for your team.

Your file cabinet just got infinite drawers.

Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, now generally available with a 1-million token window, changes how European SMBs process information. Forget breaking down documents like you used a fax machine to send a book. Your longest legal briefs or financial reports now fit in one go.

This isn't about enterprise-level hype. It's about practical capability for your team, securely handled through Google Cloud. Analysis and summarization become significantly more efficient, like upgrading from a switchboard operator to direct dial.

Pilot this capability for one specific, high-volume document task. Focus on summarization or extraction. Don't build a full solution, just test its real-world impact and cost efficiency.

The future of document processing isn't just for the big players.
