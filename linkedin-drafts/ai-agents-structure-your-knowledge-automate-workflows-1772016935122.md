# LinkedIn Draft — You're not building large software applications, but the underlying lesson is vital. This isn't about AI replacing your team; it's about *delegating* complex, structured tasks. For your firm, it means using your internal knowledge – your procedures, your templates, your client history – as the 'single source of truth' that AI agents can then leverage to automate repetitive tasks, from drafting initial documents to managing client communication.

Your internal knowledge base is about to become your firm's most valuable asset.

OpenAI just shipped a million lines of code written by AI agents. This isn't about replacing your team; it's about delegating complex, structured tasks. Think of your procedures and templates as the ultimate single source of truth, ready for automation.

Before you even consider fancy AI, clean your file cabinets. Identify one repetitive, rule-based process. Spend the next month structuring your internal documentation around it, making it explicit and machine-readable.

This disciplined approach is how you prepare for effective AI delegation. It will save you thousands down the line.

Executive takeaway: Start structuring your internal knowledge around one key process this quarter.
