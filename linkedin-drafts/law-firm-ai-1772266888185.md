# LinkedIn Draft — The 'wait and see' strategy is dead. August 2026 is no longer hypothetical. Regulators will demand documented compliance for *any* AI use, from Copilot to contract review, focusing on data governance, transparency, and risk. No more 'we're careful' — you need a plan, not just a promise.

The "wait and see" strategy for AI compliance is a flip phone in a smartphone world. August 2026 isn't a hypothetical date on a calendar; it's when regulators start asking for your documented plan.

They're not interested in your Rolodex of good intentions. They want to see your data governance, transparency protocols, and risk mitigation strategies, from Copilot to contract review. No more just saying you're "careful" with new tech.

The ELTA survey confirms what I see daily: 70% of EU law firms are unprepared. This isn't a fax machine outage; it's a fundamental shift in how you operate.

You need a concrete plan, not just a promise. Your file cabinets need to hold proof, not just potential.

Executive takeaway: Start building your AI compliance framework today.
